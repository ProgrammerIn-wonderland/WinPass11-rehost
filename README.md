## WinPass11

### The Grand Re-opening?
*NOTE: If you plan to use insiders, you need to be in the Windows Insider Release Preview channel **BEFORE** using WinPass. WinPass does not enroll you in insiders, it changes your channel while bypassing restrictions.*

🪟 [WinPass11](https://github.com/ProgrammerIn-wonderland/WinPass11-rehost/) is a tool for installing Windows 11 on unsupported hardware in a one click installer. Run a single executable and have access to Windows 11 through Insider Preview branches without having to worry about incompatibility.
